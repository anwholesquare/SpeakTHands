**Transform Hand Gestures into Speech through ESP32 Flex Sensor Data via Bluetooth**

*A project by HandsonSync*

## Overview

SpeakTHands is a Flutter mobile application that enables users to map hand gestures captured through flex sensor data from ESP32 devices via Bluetooth connection. The app converts these gestures into text and then uses text-to-speech functionality to give voice to hand movements.

## Features

### Current Implementation
- âœ… **Dark Theme UI**: Modern, accessible dark theme with gradient backgrounds
- âœ… **Bluetooth Ready**: Configured permissions and dependencies for ESP32 communication
- âœ… **Text-to-Speech**: Integrated TTS capabilities for voice output
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, animated UI with custom components
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Android and iOS

### Planned Features
- ðŸ”„ **Bluetooth Communication**: Connect and communicate with ESP32 devices
- ðŸ”„ **Gesture Recognition**: Map flex sensor data to predefined gestures
- ðŸ”„ **Custom Gesture Creation**: Allow users to create and train custom gestures
- ðŸ”„ **Voice Customization**: Multiple TTS voices and settings
- ðŸ”„ **Gesture Library**: Pre-built gesture database
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time Feedback**: Live sensor data visualization
- ðŸ”„ **Settings & Preferences**: User customization options

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.8.1 or higher
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform-specific development
- ESP32 device with flex sensors (for hardware integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/projects
   # Project is already created in: /Users/anan/Documents/research/speakThroughHand/SpeakTHands
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd SpeakTHands
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # For Android
   flutter run

   # For iOS
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

### Platform Configuration

#### Android
